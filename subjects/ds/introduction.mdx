# Data Structure

- A particular way of storing and organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently by operations.
- They provide means to manage large amounts of data efficiently, such as large databases.
- Data are simply values or set of values and database is organized collection of data.

# Abstract Data Type

- Separate notions of specification and implementation.
- Realization of a data type as a software component, i.e. focus on what can be done with the data, not how it is done.
- The interface of the ADT is defined in terms of a type and a set of operations on that type. Each operation has a determined input as well as output.
